# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I'm Martin and I am learning how to use GitHub. I've been working with Git and Hg for version control before but I wasn't using GitHub to host my projects yet. I was using Atlassian's Bitbucket and company's internal repo hosting solution for all my work up until now. I've been using GitHub only as a user - consumer to explore, download and consume or use many great SW or different projects out there.

Using GitHub as SW Engineer - developer and writing some code and hosting my repos up here is a my new journey I started this year (2021).

Sincere,
Martin
